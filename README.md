# Simple Asteroids
This project is a simple implementation of the Asteroids game. 
For the graphical component, an external library SDL2 was used.
## What has been implemented:
- game menu (main menu, pause menu, game over menu).
- counting downed asteroids and displaying it on the screen.
- centering the game relative to the player.
- two types of asteroids (small and big, which is divided into two small ones).
- three types of abilities (shield, homing missile, automatic shooting).
- run through the console with different game parameters:
"-window [weight]х[height]", "-map [weight]х[height]", "-num_asteroids [amount]", "-num_ammo [amount]".
